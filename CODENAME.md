# LeonBlow 

## Why LeonBlow?
LeonBlow is named after  who is a `"pseudo-professional"` baseball player.  

This project's codename was named after `Danganronpaâ„¢` character `Leon Kuwata`'s execution `"The 1000 blows"` which throws baseball directly to human body with the character hanged on the pole, causing bruises and finally causing death via prolonged bleeding and collapse of skeletal structure.

This reminded me of DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service) in cyber-security and since this software is emulating DDoS attack with application attack rules.  
~~And of course, Stella IT Indeed, hates DDoS Attacks. But we also need to `prepare for unfore seen consequences`.~~  

## OK, Enough of Anime Stuff. Why did you made it?
This project was developed for benchmarking Stella IT's High Performance DDoS Protection Infrastructure.  
This software **SPAMS** sets of attacks available on ruleset and sends request in parallel.
